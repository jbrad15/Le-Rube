My averages of 12 times for the pyramix duo:
<ol>
  <li> 3.52s (Feb 13)</li>
  <li> 2.52s (Feb 14)</li>
  <li> 3.01s (Feb 18)</li>
  <li> 3.31s (Feb 18)</li>
  <li> 2.57s (Feb 19)</li>
</ol>
 These is my mean of 3 times for the pryamix duo blindfolded (judged by Tyler):
 <ul>
  <li> 3.27s (Feb 19)</li>
</ul>
I think I've pretty much mastered this cube, the only improvements I have been making have come 
from easy solves and slightly faster moves./

My averages of 12 times for the skewb:

My averages of 12 times for the 2x2:
<ol>
  <li> 24.58s (Feb 14)</li>
  <li> 23.51s (Feb 18)</li>
  <li> 19.24s (Feb 20)</li>
  <li> 21.45s (Feb 20)</li>
  <li> 16.52s (Feb 20)</li>
</ol>
I have pretty much mastered the simple method of solving the 2x2, the best way for me to improve is to learn a faster way
of solving the cube (i.e. ortega)./
My mean of 3 solves for the 2x2 (judged by Tyler):
<ul>
  <li> 19.29s (Feb 21)</li>
</ul>
